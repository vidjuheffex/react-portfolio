        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> I am a Daytime Emmy Award winning visual effects supervisor (2013, "Elmo The Musical", Sesame Workshop) and software developer. I have worked primarily through Magnetic Dreams Animation Studio for over 7 years serving as both visual effects supervisor and pipeline developer in a freelance capacity. 
My background was originally in film, having attended Watkins College of Art Design + Film. I am co-owner of Untrademarked Productions, which produced our first feature film 'Worm' in 2013. Film led to Animation and VFX, where I have had a great relationship with Magnetic Dreams with responsibilties ranging from art to code.</p>
